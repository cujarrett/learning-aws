## Storage
#### S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides developers and IT teams with secure durable, highly scalable object storage. Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web service interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

#### What is S3?
- One type of storage in AWS
- S3 is a safe place to store your files
- S3 buckets are PRIVATE by default
- It is Object based storage - meaning you can upload files from 0 Bytes to 5 TB
  - Think of Objects just as files
  - Objects consist of the following:
    - Key - This is the name of the object
    - Value - This is the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes
    - Version ID (Important for versioning)
    - Metadata
    - Subresources
      - Access Control Lists
      - Torrent
- The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities
- Unlimited storage
- Files are stored in Buckets (think of them like folders). S3 is a universal namespace. The Bucket names must be unique globally.
- When you upload a file to S2 you receive a `HTTP 200 code` if the upload was successful
- Because it's object based storage, it's not suitable to install an operating system or database on (for that you'd want block based storage)

#### How does data consistency work for S3?
- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)

In other words
- If you write a new file and read it immediately afterwards you will be able to view that data.
- If you update AN EXISTING file or delete a file and read it immediately, you may get the older version, or you may not. Basically the changes to objects take a bit of time to propagate.

#### S3 Guarantees from Amazon
- Built for 99.99% availability for the S3 platform
- Amazon guarantee 99.9% availability
- Amazon guarantee 99.999999999% durability for S3 information (Remember 11 x 9's)

#### S3 Features
- Tiered Storage available
  - **S3 Standard** - 99.99 availability 99.999999999, durability, stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities, and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.
  - **S3 IA (Infrequently Accessed)** - For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee.
  - **S3 One Zone IA** - For when you want a lower cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the multiple Availability Zone data resilience.
  - **Intelligent Tiering** - Designed to cost optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. Uses machine learning to automatically move your objects to different Storage Tiers based on use.
  - **S3 Glacier** - S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and low cost storage class for data archiving. You can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper than on-premises solutions. Retrieval times are configurable from minuets to hours.
  - **S3 Glacier Deep Storage** - S3 Glacier Deep Storage is Amazon S3's lowest cost storage class where a retrieval time of 12 hours is acceptable.

- Lifecycle Management - ie. When an object is X days old have it on this tier and another tier when it hits Y days old
- Versioning
- Encryption (at rest)
- MFA for Delete optional to safeguard deletes
- Secure your data with **Access Control Lists** and **Bucket Policies**

#### S3 Charges
You are charged for S3 in the following ways:
- Strorage
- Requests
- Storage Management Pricing
- Data Transfer Pricing
- Transfer Acceleration - Enables fast, easy, secure transfers of files over long distances between your end users and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.
- Cross Region Replication Pricing - Automatic replication to another bucket in a different region

#### Access Control
- Controlling access to S3 can be done using one of the following
  - **bucket ACL**
  - **Bucker Policies**
- S3 buckets are PRIVATE by default. You can setup access control to your buckets using
  - Bucket Policies - Sets access at the bucket level
  - Access Control Lists - Sets access at the individual object level
- S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to the S3 bucket. This can be sent to another bucket and even another bucket in another account (ðŸ‘€).

#### S3 Encryption
Encryption in Transit is achieved by `SSL`/`TLS`
Encryption at Rest (Server Side) is achieved by
- Server Side
  - **S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3**
  - **AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys - SSE-KMS**
  - **Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys - SSE-C**
- Client Side

#### S3 Versioning
- Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)
- Great backup tool
- Once enabled, **Versioning cannot be disabled**, only suspended. To remove versioning you'd have to delete the bucket and create a new one.
- Integrates with **Lifecycle** rules
- Versioning's **MFA Delete** capability, which uses multi-factor authentication, can be used to provide an additional layer of security.
- If you have versioning enabled the size of your bucket is the sum of all versions.
- Deleting an object doesn't remove the object but rather places a delete marker over the object in a new version. You can delete the delete marker in that last version to restore the version before it was deleted.

#### S3 Lifecycle Management
- Automates moving your objects between the different storage tiers
- Can be used in conjunction with versioning (but it can work without versioning also)
- Can be applied to current version and if versioning is enabled previous versions

#### S3 Cross Regional Replication
- Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination bucket
- Regions must be unique
- Existing files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically. When you add new files they will be then replicated atomically.
- Delete markers are not replicated. This was a deliberate move by AWS to not have deletes auto replicated across all buckets.
- Replication of deleting individual versions of a object (file) will not be replicated

#### Transfer Acceleration
Uses CloudFront Edge network to accelerate your uploads to S3. Instead of uploading directly to your S3 bucket, you can use a distinct URL to upload directly to an Edge Location which will then transfer that file to S3. You will get a distinct URL to upload to. For example: `foo.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com`.

#### CloudFront
A content delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages and other content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage, and a content delivery server.

CloudFront can be used to deliver your entire website, including dynamic, static, streaming, and interactive content using a global network of edge locations. Requests for your content are automatically routed to the nearest edge location, so content is delivered with the best possible performance.

- CloudFront is a Networking & Content Delivery solution in AWS
- Edge Locations are not just READ only - you can write to them too (ie put an object on to them as seen in S3 Transfer Acceleration.)
- Objects are cached for the TTL (Time To Live) which is configurable
- You can clear ached objects, but you will be charged. This is called invalidating the cache.

#### CloudFront Terminology
- **Edge Location** - A location where content will be cached. This is separate to an AWS Region/ Availability Zone.
- **Origin** - This is the origin of all files that the CDN will distribute. This can be an S3 Bucket, an EC2 Instance, an Elastic Load Balancer, or Route 53
- **Distribution** - This is the name given to the CDN which consists of a collection of Edge Locations
- **Web Distribution** - Typically used for websites
- **RTMP** - Used for Media Streaming
